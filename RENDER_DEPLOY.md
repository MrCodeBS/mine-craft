# Deploy to Render - Step by Step Guide

## 🚀 Render Deployment (Full Multiplayer)

### Prerequisites:
1. GitHub account
2. Your code pushed to GitHub

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Render
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Click **"New"** → **"Web Service"**
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Select this project repository

### Step 3: Configure the Service
**Fill in these settings:**
- **Name**: `minecraft-multiplayer-game`
- **Environment**: `Node`
- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Instance Type**: `Free` (for testing)

### Step 4: Environment Variables (Optional)
- **PORT**: `3000` (Render will override this automatically)

### Step 5: Deploy
- Click **"Create Web Service"**
- Wait for deployment (takes 2-3 minutes)
- Your game will be live at: `https://minecraft-multiplayer-game.onrender.com`

## 🎮 What You Get:
- ✅ Full multiplayer support
- ✅ Socket.io real-time communication
- ✅ Persistent server
- ✅ Auto-scaling
- ✅ HTTPS by default
- ✅ Free tier available

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

### If build fails:
1. Make sure `package.json` has correct start script
2. Check that all dependencies are listed

### If game doesn't load:
1. Check the logs in Render dashboard
2. Make sure the server is listening on the right port

## 🌐 Your Game URLs:
- **Game**: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`
- **API/Socket**: Same URL (Render handles routing)

## 💡 Pro Tips:
1. Free tier may "sleep" after 15 minutes of inactivity  
2. Paid tier ($7/month) keeps it always running
3. You can set up custom domains later
4. **OPTIMIZED**: Game now loads super fast with minimal world generation!
5. **PERFORMANCE**: Reduced chunk loading for instant multiplayer connections

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations:
- **Faster world generation**: Only 3 block layers instead of 64
- **Smaller chunks**: 1 chunk radius instead of 3 
- **Reduced view range**: 10 blocks instead of 20
- **Instant loading**: No more waiting for massive world generation!
